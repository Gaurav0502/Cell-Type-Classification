## Image Processing

We perform the feature extraction of the cell images and following operations:
- Reading the image files and resizing them.
- Conversion of the images into grayscale and mean rgb value images.
- Transforming the pixel matrix into a row matrix.
- Consolidate all the image features and finally obtain two datasets dataset_grayscale.csv and dataset_rgb.csv.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We explore the images data and the previously extracted features as follows:
- The file formats among the images
- Types of dimensions of the images.
- Mean image of each class.
- Correlation Analysis.
- Standardization of the data.
- Principal Component Analysis.
- Encoding the categorical variables.

## Model Building

We aim to train all fundamental models after dimensionality reduction:
1. K-Nearest Neighbours
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machines
4. Decision Tree
5. Multilayer Perceptron

Lastly, we explore one of the Deep Learning models : Convolution Neural Network(CNN).
