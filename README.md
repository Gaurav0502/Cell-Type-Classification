# Problem Statement
Hematology is the study of blood and its disorders. In this project, we focus on an Medical Image Classification problem comprising of microscopic images of blood cells. This can be useful as computational tool for hematological diagnosis of blood disorders.
# Dataset
The dataset used is "A dataset for microscopic peripheral blood cell images for development of automatic recognition systems"(https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/snkd93bnjr/1) from the Mendeley repository.
